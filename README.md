# Vocabulary app for maths problem-solving for Year 5 pupils.
The maths learning application is a UROP placement project, all of which I designed and programmed. I have used Java/Android and CSS for styling to develop the application. 

The application has three levels, and each level has four interactive games. Each interactive game is composed of 4 classes, and in total, the project has 64 Classes. Therefore, it was a learning curve to manage all the Classes effectively. 

The application employs concepts of Object Oriented Programming to create blueprints for several objects in the game. 

This application is designed to teach 12 different mathematical terms using problem-solving. Each level has a unique task, appearance and character.
